# v3 rationale

:bulb: functions instead of references to skin bricks of fixed width

Advantages:

* Parametrizable look and feel
* Fine grain control over period / phase
* Clean generated SVG

* [[301](https://github.com/wavedrom/wavedrom/issues/301)] custom edge colors
* [[298](https://github.com/wavedrom/wavedrom/issues/298)] any signal phase without gaps
* CSS styling
